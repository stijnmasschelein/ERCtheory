\section{Introduction}

We model a two period game with buyer and sellers. The buyers offer a contract with price, $P_i$, and a potential control system in each period, $i$. We explain the control system later. The seller decides on how much effort $e_i$ to put in to the job after they accept the contract. The buyer's profit is given by $\pi_{Bi} = Se_i - P$ while the seller's profit is given by $\pi_{Si} = P - C e_i^2$ \footnote{This is not exactly what we did in the experiment but it is pretty close and in line with most simple models.}.

The social preferences are based on the $\alpha$-model in \citep{Bolton2008a}. That is there are two types of sellers: fair sellers who minimise the difference between between the seller's profit and the buyer's profit and egocentric sellers who maximise their own profit. We assume that there are a proportion of $\alpha$ fair sellers and $1-\alpha$ egocentric sellers. As a start, we assume that this proportion, $\alpha$, is coming knowledge.

First, we assume there are two sellers and one buyer. This means that there is
